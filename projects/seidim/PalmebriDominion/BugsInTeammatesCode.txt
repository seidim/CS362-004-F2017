Bug #1:

Found in Smithy card

While running the unit tests written for assignments 3 and 4, I was able to detect a bug in the smithy function of my teammates’ code.   
The bug that was detected was that the hand count doesn’t increment properly.  
This bug occurs every time the code is ran whether using the unit cardtest1 or the randomtestcard1 code.   
By looking at the smithy function in the dominion.c file from my teammates’ code, I was able to trace the root cause of the bug.  
The for loop in the function to draw card was changed from “ i < 3 to i < 6.”  This resulted in 3 extra cards being drawn.  
This bug can easily be fixed by changed the for loop back to “ i < 3” and that should fix the recurring bug.

Bug #2:

Found in village card

Another bug that was detected in Brian’s dominion code using my unit tests from previous assignments was found in the village card function.   
The bug found in the village function was the incorrect amount of actions being added.  This bug was traced back to village function.  
The bug was traced back to the number of actions being changed from 2 actions added to 5 actions.  
This bug was recurring every time the tests were run.  This bug can easily be fixed by changing the number of actions in the village function 
from 5 actions added to 2 actions added.   “state->numActions = state->numActions + 5;” should be changed to “state->numActions = state->numActions + 2;”  
This should correct the bug and yield valid test results.
